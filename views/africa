        - Eruptive activity at the Shira center started about 2.5 million years ago, with the last important phase happening about 1.9 million years ago

        - Both Mawenzi and Kibo began erupting about 1 million years ago
        - The youngest dated rocks at Mawenzi are about 448,000 years old
        - Kibo is the largest cone on the mountain and is more than 24 km (15 mi) wide at the Saddle Plateau altitude
        - The last activity at Kibo, dated to 150,000–200,000 years ago, created the current Kibo summit crater
        - About 100,000 years ago, part of Kibo's crater rim collapsed, creating the area known as the Western Breach and the Great Barranco
        - Kibo has more than 250 parasitic cones on its northwest and southeast flanks that were formed between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago

        - In the late 1880s, the summit of Kibo was completely covered by an ice cap about 20 km2 (7.7 sq mi) in extent, with outlet glaciers cascading down the western and southern slopes
        - The slope glaciers retreated rapidly between 1912 and 1953, in response to a sudden shift in climate at the end of the 19th century that made them "drastically out of equilibrium", and more slowly thereafter`,

    - Industrialization: In 1906, American John Munroe Longyear established the Arctic Coal Company in Svalbard. The company mined coal and established the town of Longyearbyen. The Swedes, Russians and British also established settlements for mining.

        - Hypogea: Recent discoveries (2010–2011) of hypogea (structures carved into embankments) on the islands of Corvo, Santa Maria, and Terceira allude to a human presence on the islands before the Portuguese.
        - Vikings: There is evidence to suggest that the Vikings were the first humans to arrive on the Azores. Researchers have discovered 5-beta-stigmasterol (a compound found in the feces of livestock such as sheep and cattle) in sediment samples from between 700 and 850 CE. They also found evidence of fires from this period being used to clear land for livestock.
        - Exploration: The Azores archipelago began to appear on portolan charts during the 14th century, well before its official discovery date. The first map to depict the Azores was the Medici Atlas (1351).
        - Portuguese Exploration: Prince Henry the Navigator (1394–1460) had an important role in the exploration of the Azores. He added his own financial support to the efforts of the Portuguese crown and financed the construction of new ships, establishing naval schools to harness seafaring knowledge and promoting new technologies and their use.
        - Settlement: The "official" settlement of the archipelago began in Santa Maria, where the first settlement was constructed in the area of Baía dos Anjos (in the north of the island), and quickly moved to the southern coast (to the area that is now the modern town of Vila do Porto)."
